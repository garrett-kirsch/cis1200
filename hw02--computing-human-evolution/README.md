### CIS 1200 Homework 2: Computing Human Evolution

Before you begin, you _must_ read the [Homework Description](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1200/current/hw/hw02). It contains more background about the assignment than is found on this page.

To start the assignment, open the file `dna.ml` and begin there. Remember that you need to write your tests in `dnaTest.ml`.

There are a few important CIS 1200-specific menu options we have provided (on the top row):

- **Build Project** - compiles the project (useful for debugging and checking for warnings)
- **Run Project** - compiles and runs your project, showing the resulting test output in the terminal console.
- **Clean Project** - rebuilds the project from scratch (mainly useful if you've made changes to several files)
- **Style Check Project** - checks for project for programming style and give warnings/suggestions
- **Zip (for submission)** - creates a file called submit.zip that is suitable for homework submission (see below)
- **Utop** - starts the OCaml interactive session

Once you are finished, use the "Zip (for submission)" menu item to create a file called
"hw02-submit(<time>).zip" and upload it here:
