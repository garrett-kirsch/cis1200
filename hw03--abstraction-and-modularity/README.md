### CIS 1200 Homework 3: Higher-order Functions, Abstraction, and Modularity

Please follow the instructions available here:

- [Homework Description](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1200/current/hw/hw03)

There are a few important CIS 1200-specific menu options we have provided (on the top row):

- **Build Project** - compiles the project (useful for debugging and checking for warnings)
- **Run ...** - compiles and runs your project, showing the resulting test output in the terminal console. Note that the Codio menu now provides several "Run ..." choices, to let you test different parts of the assignment.
- **Clean Project** - rebuilds the project from scratch (mainly useful if you've made changes to several files)
- **Style Check Project** - checks for project for programming style and give warnings/suggestions
- **Zip (for submission)** - creates a file called submit.zip that is suitable for homework submission (see below)
- **Utop** - starts the OCaml interactive session

Once you are finished, use the "Zip (for submission)" menu item to create a file called
`hw03-submit(<time>).zip` and upload it here:
