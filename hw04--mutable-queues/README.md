### CIS 1200 Homework 4: Mutable Queues

Please follow the instructions available here:

- [Homework Description](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1200/current/hw/hw04)

There are a few important CIS 1200-specific menu options we have provided (on the top row):
- **Build Project** - compiles the project (useful for debugging and checking for warnings)
- **Run ...** - compiles and runs your project, showing the resulting test output in the terminal console. Note that the Codio menu now provides several "Run ..." choices, to let you test different parts of the assignment.
- **Clean Project** - rebuilds the project from scratch (mainly useful if you've made changes to several files)
- **Style Check Project** - checks for project for programming style and give warnings/suggestions
- **Zip (for submission)** - creates a file called submit.zip that is suitable for homework submission (see below)
- **Utop** - starts the OCaml interactive session

(NOTE: we have disabled the **Prettify** option because this tool sometimes causes changes that don't comply with our style guide!)

Once you are finished, use the "Zip (for submission)" menu item to create a file called
"hw04-submit(<time>).zip" and upload it here:

Here are some checkpoints to keep you on track with this assignment. Note: we encourage you to read ahead in the notes!

- *Checkpoint 1:* After Lecture 13, you can give problem 1-2 in imp.ml a try!
- *Checkpoint 2:* After Lecture 14, you can complete problem 3 in imp.ml and get started (working ahead) on 4-8.
- *Checkpoint 3:* After learning the Lecture 15 material, you can complete problems 4-8.
- *Checkpoint 4:* After learning the Lecture 16 material, you double-check that your solutions use tail recursion (the natural way to write the code _is_ tail recursive).

(Tail recursion is a programming style that avoids using space on the computer's stack by passing extra arguments to recursive functions.  It is covered in Lecture 16.)
